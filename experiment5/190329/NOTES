In MANUAL directory, a series of six wire measurements were taken while moving the cutting machine manually.  

In the base directory here, tests were taken while advancing the torch into the disc.  The test was stopped because the urethane belt overheated.

The a nominal 20V DC was applied to the torch.  With 16.7V at the torch, with a 1M resistor, there was a 0.780 signal at the DAC (see baseline.dat).

These are the first successful measurements with the Langmuir probe.
