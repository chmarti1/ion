# Ion 1D Model

The one-dimensional ion model includes formation, recombination, diffusion, convection, and electrical mobility in a one-dimensional domain with absorbing surfaces at either end of the domain.  Written in Python, the directory, `source`, contains the code for the project.  `data` contains the post-processed results of the model, and `export` contains plots and high-level result data.
