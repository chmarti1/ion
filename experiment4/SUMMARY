# Summary of data
There are three types of tests conducted here: incline tests where a plate set at a deliberate angle is cut, speed tests where a level plate is cut with varying speed, and height tests where a level plate is cut under constant conditions.

## 190114 (1/14/2019)
These were the first attempts to collect data while cutting.  The ground wire was disconnected, so no valid data were collected.

## 190128 (1/28/2019)
Tests 1 and 2 were not valid because the ground and torch leads were reversed.  Test 3 was the only data collected.  The standoff was not noted!

## 190130 (1/30/2019)
Three triangle wave tests on a sloped plate ranging in height from 0.1 to 0.4 inches.  Each test used a different speed, but identical preheat and cutting O2 settings.

## 190211 (2/11/2019)
Three triangle wave tests on a sloped plate ranging in height from 0.1 to 0.43 inches.  These supposedly replicate the tests conducted in 190130.

## 190222 (2/22/2019)
These are the first tests conducted with a sine excitation.  The fuel/oxygen ratios were also more realistic, and the tests were conducted with a constant standoff.  However, the height and level controls on the plates were not yet adequate.

## 190301 (3/1/2019)
Attempted to use shims to control level; took eight constant standoff measurements.

## 190315 (3/15/2019)
Three variable speed tests and one incline test.  Experimental control for height was not adequate.

## 190320 (3/20/2019)
First tests using the three-point plate leveling system.  Eleven tests at constant standoff.

## 190322 (3/22/2019)
Two speed tests, one incline test, and twelve constant standoff tests using the plate leveling method.  Five of the tests were at f/o ratio 0.65 instead of 0.78.

## 190325 (3/25/2019)
Two speed tests and two pierce tests.

## 190327 (3/27/2019)
Identified super-harmonics in the sine measurements; experimented with different excitations to ensure linearity.  Seven tests with 0-10uA excitations, and twelve tests were with 5-15uA excitation.
